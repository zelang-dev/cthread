* @mainpage CThread API Reference
*
* @section intro_sec Introduction
* CThread is a minimal, portable implementation of basic threading
* classes for C.
*
* They closely mimic the functionality and naming of the C11 standard, and
* should be easily replaceable with the corresponding standard variants.
*
* @section port_sec Portability
* The Win32 variant uses the native Win32 API for implementing the thread
* classes, while for other systems, the POSIX threads API (pthread) is used.
*
* For more detailed information, browse the different sections of this
* documentation. A good place to start is:
* cthread.h.
